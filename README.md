 ABOUT PROJECT and DATASET- CASE STUDY:
 
The goal of the experiment was to estimate the occupancy of a room using non-intrusive sensors. 
Non-intrusive sensors are those that do not require any physical contact with the object being sensed.In this case, the object being sensed is the room and its occupancy.

The experiment used five different types of non-intrusive sensors to collect data: temperature, light, sound, CO2, and digital passive infrared (PIR). Each sensor measures a 
different aspect of the room's environment, which can be used to infer the presence or absence of occupants.
The temperature sensor measures the temperature of the room in degrees Celsius. Changes in temperature can indicate the presence of occupants, 
as their body heat will increase the temperature of the room.

The light sensor measures the level of illumination in the room in Lux. Changes in light levels can 
indicate the presence of occupants, as they may turn lights on or off as they enter or leave the room.
The sound sensor measures the level of sound in the room in volts. Changes in sound levels can indicate the presence of 
occupants, as they may make noise as they move around the room.

The CO2 sensor measures the level of carbon dioxide in the room in parts per million (PPM). Changes in CO2 levels
can indicate the presence of occupants, as they exhale carbon dioxide when they breathe.

The CO2 slope sensor measures the slope of CO2 values taken in a sliding window. This can provide an indication of the rate 
at which CO2 levels are changing, which can help to identify sudden changes in occupancy.

The PIR sensor detects motion in the room and provides a binary value indicating whether motion has been detected or not. This can be used to detect the presence 
of occupants who are moving around in the room.
The data collected by these sensors was used to estimate the occupancy of the room. The ground truth data was obtained by counting the number of people who entered and left the room during the experiment. This data was used to train and test machine learning
algorithms to estimate occupancy based on the sensor data.
